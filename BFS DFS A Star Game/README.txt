CS 171 - A
Final Project 

Python Files require the Turtle Library to be run.
Editing the maze is possible through the main code.

The DFS and BFS python files are the integrated codes passed during the Midterms that was given a GUI.

Breadth First Search
The BFS with A Star python file, when run, automatically solves the maze and returns the cost of movement from one state to the other.
How to play:
The user can still play the game by editing the maze in the grid (setting up walls, the starting point, and the end point) and by watching the program
solve the maze itself.

Depth First Search
When run, the user is asked what searching method it wants to do (either Depth First Search or A* Heuristic). The program solves the given maze
depending on what the user chose as its method of solving. This is specifically done by solving for the possible pathway/coordinates of the 
maze given with the starting and ending point in which the user chooses.

How to play:

The user has to run the program and is immediately asked which searching method does he/she want to use. After this, depending on the searching method,
the user is thrown with the coordinates that the program generates in order to solve for the maze. The user is then asked what coordinates were given
in order for the program to plot the pathway of the given coordinates.

As a bonus, in the next cell, a program generates an animated display of what the maze looks like so that the user can better see the obstacles and the whole maze
itself
